# ship-motion-correction-for-EUREC4A-campaign-
Algorithm to correct cloud radar and MRR observations from ship motions. 

The code has been developed based on a full theorethical description available upon request.

DATA NEEDED TO BE RUN:
- ship motion data: time series of the ship motions variables: heave, roll, pitch, yaw
- FMCW radar data: standard variables plus the partial integration times of the chirps defined for the measurement mode.
